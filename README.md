# CompanyDashboard

Basic dashboard made with HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery and Bootstrap.

Features multiple subdivision for an imaginary company (Tech Team, 3D Team, Human Resources Team) all of which is tracked on a MySQL database. You are able to: Make users, modify users, view all users, post a leave of absence request & able to be reviewed (only those with Human Resources permission) alongside other small things I probably forgot.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend changing the password encryption as it just uses a Whirlpool hash with no salting, I'll probably change this myself in a few days.

Also big thanks to this person for the sidebar:
